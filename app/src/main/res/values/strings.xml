        as \'Qila-i-Mubarak\', meaning the blessed fort, as it was the royal residence of Mughals.\n\nDuring
        the British colonial rule, this fort was mainly used as a cantonment, which remained under the
        control of Indian Army after Indian Independence. This fort has various structures including
        Diwan-i-Aam, Diwan-i-Khas, Nahr-i-Behisht, Zenana, Mumtaz Mahal, Moti Masjid and Hayat Bakhsh Bagh.

    <string name="Bukhara_description">The food at Bukhara is cooked in clay ovens or tandoor in the
        traditional style of the Indian North-West Frontier region. This style of cooking requires
        great expertise on the part of the chefs, since the meat is not accompanied by any sauce or
        gravy, but is only pre-marinated and cooked before serving. It takes a Chef years of meticulous
        training and dedication to master the technique of the art of making the breads that are a
        vital part of the cuisine, or to acquire the ability to gauge spices, mix marinades, and the
        most vital of all, to judge the heat of the tandoor and the time necessary for each dish to
        be perfectly cooked.\n\nThe world renowned Dal Bukhara, a combination of whole black lentils
        (urad dal), tomatoes, ginger and garlic, is cooked and simmered over slow coal fires of the
        tandoor overnight for 18 hours at a stretch! It is sure to be the longest cooked lentil in
        the world!\n\nAnother unique feature of the cuisine is the use of prime cuts of meat,
        marinated with the choicest of spices and skilfully cooked on high heat, while retaining
        their tender moistness.</string>

    <string name="Motimahal_description">The story of Moti Mahal Delux dates back to year 1920, when
        Mokha Singh Lamba started a small eatery called Moti Mahal in Peshawar, British India. Kundan
        Lal Gujral worked for Mokha Singh at Moti Mahal in Peshawar. Moti Mahal was the first to dig
        up a tandoor right in the middle of the eatery and since then Peshawar was introduced to the
        culinary art of tandoori chicken by them. This was a success and soon there was in demand for
        Tandoori at social gatherings and wedding feasts where they would use an improvised tandoor.
        \n\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, Kundan Lal Gujral, a Punjabi Hindu, fled to Delhi with
        his family. Uncertainty faced them as they had neither money nor the resources to start afresh
        in life. They dropped off in Delhi to try their luck. Roaming the streets, they chanced upon
        an abandoned thara in Daryaganj, and then considered a newer part of Old Delhi. Kundan Lal
        Gujral then started Moti Mahal, Daryaganj with another partner, Thakur Das Mago. Moti Mahal
        further went on to invent butter chicken and dal makhani. This brought about a revolution in
        taste and a place on the International Gourmet Map.\n\nThus was born the Moti Mahal Restaurant,
        which contributed significantly to putting India on the food map of the world. Indian leaders
        like Jawahar Lal Nehru, Indira Gandhi,Zakir Hussain among various foreign dignitaries like
        Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. have visited Moti Mahal to sample
        Kundan\'s innovations – its tandoori delicacies on various occasions.  M. Maulana Azad, the
        great Muslim leader, reportedly told the Shah of Iran that while in India he must make two
        visits - to the Taj Mahal and Moti Mahal. Later in 1970\'s Kundan Lal’s son Mr Nand Lal \'Bila\'
        Gujral, upon the exit of Thakur Das Mago from the partnership, expanded Moti Mahal Delux in
        south Delhi to establish Moti Mahal Delux Chain of Restaurants.</string>
